📚 School Library Inventory System
A PHP-based web application for managing a school library. The system allows librarians to maintain a catalog of books,
track which students have been issued specific book copies, and manage system user accounts with role-based access
control.
It is designed for secondary school environments, organizing students by form and stream, and linking book issuance
records directly to student admission numbers. User accounts require confirmation, suggesting an admin-approval workflow
for new librarian registrations.
Each book copy is identified by a QR code label printed via a label printer. The QR code encodes the book's ISBN and
serial number, and librarians can scan these codes directly from the system interface to quickly issue or receive
books — eliminating manual data entry during transactions.
